Calculation of intersubband plasmons in doped carbon nanotubes.


We theoretically investigate intersubband plasmon excitations in doped single wall carbon 
nanotubes (SWNTs) by examining the dependence of plasmon frequency on the nanotube diameter, 
chirality, and Fermi energy. The intersubband plasmons can be excited by light with polarization 
perpendicular to the nanotube axis and thus the plasmon excitations corresponds to optical 
transitions between the two different subbands, which are sensitive to the Fermi energy. 
In every SWNT, this mechanism leads to the emergence of the optical absorption peak at the 
plasmon frequency for a given Fermi energy, E_F. The plasmon frequencies calculated for many 
SWNTs with diameter d < 2 nm exhibit a dependence on (1/d)^(-0.7) and the frequencies are further 
affected by Fermi energy as E_F^0.25. With this knowledge, it is possible to develop a map of 
intersubband plasmon excitations in doped SWNTs that could be useful to quickly estimate the 
doping level and also be an alternative way to characterize nanotube chirality.
